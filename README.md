# Predictive-Maintenance-Alerts-system
This project focuses on developing a Predictive Maintenance Alert system using NLP and text analysis to analyze maintenance logs, service reports, and user manuals. The goal is to predict potential vehicle issues before they become serious problems, therefor notifying car owners and service centers about the need for preventive maintenance.
### Predictive Maintenance Alerts System
## Project Overview
The Predictive Maintenance Alerts system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze vehicle maintenance logs. It aims to identify potential issues early on, aiding in preventative maintenance and reducing the likelihood of unexpected vehicle breakdowns.
## Features
 Data Import: Ability to process maintenance logs from Excel or CSV files.
 Text Preprocessing: Implements text cleaning and preprocessing to facilitate analysis.
 Issue Prediction: Employs rule-based logic to highlight potential maintenance issues.
 Extensibility: Designed for easy extension with machine learning models for enhanced prediction capabilities.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or newer. Download and installation instructions are available at python.org.
## Installation

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/urvashiba/Predictive-Maintenance-Alerts-system.git
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd predictive-maintenance-alerts
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare Your Data: Ensure your maintenance logs are stored in an Excel or CSV file with a column for text entries.
Configure the Script: Adjust predictive_maintenance_alerts.py to align with your data file's format and column names.
