# Predictive-Maintenance-Alerts-system
This project focuses on developing a Predictive Maintenance Alert system using NLP and text analysis to analyze maintenance logs, service reports, and user manuals. The goal is to predict potential vehicle issues before they become serious problems, therefor notifying car owners and service centers about the need for preventive maintenance.
Predictive Maintenance Alerts System
Project Overview
The Predictive Maintenance Alerts system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze vehicle maintenance logs. It aims to identify potential issues early on, aiding in preventative maintenance and reducing the likelihood of unexpected vehicle breakdowns. This Python-based system processes maintenance log entries, applies text preprocessing, and utilizes a rule-based approach for issue detection.

Features
Data Import: Ability to process maintenance logs from Excel or CSV files.
Text Preprocessing: Implements text cleaning and preprocessing to facilitate analysis.
Issue Prediction: Employs rule-based logic to highlight potential maintenance issues.
Extensibility: Designed for easy extension with machine learning models for enhanced prediction capabilities.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or newer. Download and installation instructions are available at python.org.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/predictive-maintenance-alerts.git
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd predictive-maintenance-alerts
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare Your Data: Ensure your maintenance logs are stored in an Excel or CSV file with a column for text entries.
Configure the Script: Adjust predictive_maintenance_alerts.py to align with your data file's format and column names.
Run the Script: Execute the script with Python to analyze your maintenance logs:
bash
Copy code
python predictive_maintenance_alerts.py
Review Results: The script outputs predictions indicating logs that might signal potential issues.
Customization
Adjust the predict_issue function within the script to modify the criteria used for detecting issues.
For more sophisticated predictions, consider integrating machine learning models in place of the rule-based logic.
Data Privacy
Please ensure responsible handling of maintenance log data, especially if containing sensitive information, adhering to applicable data protection laws.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Ensure to update tests as appropriate.
